# Fittrack-Pro
Basic web design for a fitness app which rewards based on Goal Completion
🚀 What I Learned
During the development of FitTrack Pro, I gained valuable hands-on experience and knowledge in the following areas:

🧠 Hugging Face Spaces & Gradio
Learned how to use Hugging Face Spaces to quickly deploy interactive machine learning applications.

Used Gradio to create a user-friendly front-end interface for fitness tracking, BMI calculation, and calorie monitoring.

⚙️ AI Integration
Integrated basic machine learning logic into a web interface to offer personalized feedback based on BMI.

Understood how to process user inputs and use simple condition-based logic to generate customized fitness advice.

🌐 Web App Design
Designed a clean, functional UI using Gradio’s built-in components like sliders, input fields, and buttons.

Focused on user experience, ensuring the tool is intuitive and responsive.

📊 Health & Fitness Logic
Gained understanding of BMI calculation and how calorie goals can be set based on user data like age, height, and weight.

Implemented a simple reward system to keep users motivated by converting progress into points.

🧩 Project Structuring & Deployment
Learned how to structure a small AI-powered project for clarity and maintainability.

Deployed the project publicly using Hugging Face's free hosting tools.
